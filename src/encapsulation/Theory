encapsulation = it is mechanism of wrapping the data (variable) and behaviour/action on the data(method) in a single 
unit .
 purpose of encapsulation
 1. to put control on a class 
 
 How to implement encapsulation 
 1. make all the variables private 
 2. provide access (read and write) through setters and getters method 
 
 Benefits
 1. security
 
 encapsulation is a information hiding? 
  No
  
  Information is a piece of knowledge 
  data in context of encapsulation means resource
  
  Scope
  static variables>instance variable>method argument>local variable
  
 
 method signature= method name + argument
  method overloading 
  1.method name must be same.
  2.argument must be different.
     argument might be different based on type.
      argument might be different based on number of arguments.
       argument might be different based on argument order.
 3.  Don't  bother on return type
      
 
  
 
 
  
 calling order in method overloading
  1.exact matching
  2.byte,short,int,long,float,double (if not exact matching then compiler will search next immediate primitive their matching )
         char,int,long,float,double
  3.exact matching wrapper class only
  4.matching var argument 
  5. compilation error
